# 🦘 Kangaroo Jumper

A fast-paced, 2D endless runner built with **Python** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and the **Pygame** in conjunction with **Tkinter** libraries. This project was developed as part of our Python OOP module.

## ✨ Features

* **OOP Architecture:** Clean code structure using dedicated classes for the Kangaroo, Obstacles, Power-ups, and Environment.
* **Double Jump Mechanic:** Precise movement control with gravity-based physics and velocity management.
* **Dynamic Difficulty:** Game speed increases over time using a speed increment system (SPEED\_INCREMENT = 0.005).
* **Power-Up System:**
    * 🟡 **Invincibility:** Allows the kangaroo to pass through obstacles safely for a limited duration.
    * 🟢 **Double Points:** Multiplier that doubles the score for every obstacle cleared.
* **Collectibles:** Animated gold coins that provide a score boost of 50 points each.
* **Persistence:** High scores are automatically saved to and loaded from a local text file.
* **Hybrid UI:** Integrated **Tkinter** for menu navigation and **Pygame** for the core game engine.
